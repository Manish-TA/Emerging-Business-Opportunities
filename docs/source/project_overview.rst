==================
Project Overview
==================

The project aims to help **Manufacturer A**, a leading Food & Beverage (F&B) brand, understand consumer preferences through thematic analysis of sales, social media, and Google search data. It focuses on identifying key drivers of product sales, estimating the impact of various demand signals, and recommending actionable levers to drive growth.

The project involves multiple datasets provided by the client, including:

- Sales data (at the UPC level)
- Social media mentions
- Google search volume
- Product-to-theme mappings
- Manufacturer information

These datasets are used to build a comprehensive view of how consumer interest in different themes evolves and how it impacts the client’s market position.

Final Deliverables
------------------

- Cleaned and transformed datasets aggregated at a recommended time granularity
- Visual exploratory data analysis (EDA) highlighting market share, theme-wise trends, and transition patterns between social, search, and sales
- A sales model estimating the effect of external signals and pricing
- Recommendations for increasing sales through actionable business levers

Approach
========

The project follows a structured approach with the following key stages:

Data Cleaning & Validation
--------------------------

- Process and clean all input datasets: sales, social media, search trends, and mapping files
- Handle missing values, inconsistencies, sparsity, and anomalies
- Recommend a suitable time granularity (e.g., weekly) based on coverage and consistency

Data Integration & Feature Engineering
--------------------------------------

- Merge datasets using product and theme mapping files to align all data at the common **Theme + Time** level
- Generate engineered features, including lagged variables, to evaluate lead-lag effects across social, search, and sales

Exploratory Data Analysis
-------------------------

- Analyze overall market share and identify major competitors within each theme
- Detect emerging themes across data sources
- Validate the hypothesis that trends flow from social media to search and then to sales
- Measure latency between channels and assess variation across themes

Model Development
-----------------

- Build a regression model with aggregated client sales at the theme level as the dependent variable
- Use the model to estimate the effect of social, search, and other variables (e.g., price, competition)
- Assess model performance and ensure interpretability

Insights & Recommendations
--------------------------

- Identify high-opportunity themes with strong growth potential
- Highlight controllable levers that the client can use to improve performance
- Simulate scenarios to estimate strategies for achieving a 5% sales uplift


===========
Evaluation
===========

The success of the project is evaluated on two dimensions:

Model Performance
-----------------

- Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., R², MAPE) to assess predictive accuracy
- Perform validation using historical data and hold-out sets to ensure reliability
- Analyze model coefficients to understand variable impacts

Business Relevance
------------------

- Validate insights with stakeholders
- Ensure alignment between model findings and real-world consumer trends
- Confirm that latency effects and emerging theme identification support actionable decisions


============
Architecture
============

The project is organized into the following layers to ensure a structured and traceable workflow:

Development Setup
-----------------

- Source code is organized into separate modules for data processing, feature engineering, and modeling
- Separate scripts or notebooks are used for exploratory analysis, model building, and validation
- Configuration files manage data sources and processing steps
- Lightweight tests are implemented to validate data processing logic

Pipeline Flow
-------------

1. Ingest raw datasets
2. Clean and validate the data
3. Merge datasets based on mappings
4. Aggregate and transform features
5. Train and evaluate models
6. Generate visualizations and insights

Model Deployment
----------------

- Model outputs are used for business recommendations
- Model performance and results are documented and shared with stakeholders

The architecture is designed to support transparency, traceability, and reproducibility of the entire analytical process.
